# Lite Request

**What**: Add sort dropdown to campaign browse page (newest, most funded, ending soon)

**Why**: Fixes issue #9 - backend API already supports sort params, frontend just needs UI

**Scope**: 1 file, ~25 lines

**Files likely affected**:
- packages/client/src/pages/BrowseCampaigns.jsx
